# THE-STARS-TELL-YOUR-STORY

Your destiny is written in the stars
The chapters compiled in the constellations
You need only look up and align yourself
To your true potential 
Awaken, my child


I am exploring my artistic side as I learn generative art techniques

I want to use code and poetry to help me express myself artisticlly 

The code is the DNA, The art piece is the flesh and the poetry is the soul

This is a rule I have given myself as a guideline while I try to figure out how it all comes together 

This code was written using the [Processing](https://processing.org/) IDE 

This code is based on [Daniel Shiffman's](https://shiffman.net/) Perlin noise implementation
