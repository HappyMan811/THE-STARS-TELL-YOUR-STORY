# THE-STARS-TELL-YOUR-STORY

Your destiny is written in the stars
The chapters compiled in the constellations
You need only look up and align yourself
To your true potential 
Awaken, my child


I am exploring my artistic side as I learn generative art techniques
I want to use code and poetry to help me express myself artisticlly 

The code is the DNA, The art piece is the flesh and the poetry is the soul

This the rule I have given myself as a guideline 
While I try to figure out how it all comes together 


This code is based on Daniel Shiffman's Perlin noise implementation
